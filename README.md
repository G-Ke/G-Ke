I'm a **Customer Experience Professional** with a background in technical customer support and customer success. I've worked in various industries, from one of the nation's largest non-profits to SaaS startups in prop-tech and translation management.

When people have problems, I view it as an opportunity to learn and grow personally while getting the satisfaction of teaching and guiding someone else. As someone who routinely creates technical problems for themselves to solve, I'm always looking for new challenges to tackle when someone is experiencing a problem of their own.
